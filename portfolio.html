<h3>Five things About Me</h3>
</center>
<ol>
  <li>I grew up in the Portland are and received a bachelor's degree in Psychology.</li>
  <li>I have spent nearly five years living abroad and speak three languages.</li>
  <li>I have worked in the field of international education in administrative roles, leading eight student groups in both Costa Rica and Italy, and teaching English in Spain for three years.</li>
  <li>I decided to take an evening coding class to see if I liked it and if it really "is just like learning a new language".</li>
  <li>I enjoy sharing meals with friends, going on hikes and adventures, and cats.</li>
